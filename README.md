Sega Saturn multipurporse cartridge. It will mimic Power Memory / Backup RAM, 1MB ROMs from KoF and Ultraman, and 1M/4M RAM expansion. More than that, it should emulate Sega Saturn modems, and launch any 3rd party code, for example PseudoSaturn.
Cart is based on Altera MAX 10 FPGA with external SDRAM and internal Nios II soft CPU.
